# Captain Node Pre-mining Tutorial

Dear Captain Node Owner, it's time to activate your Captain Node and start pre-mining on Tabi Testnet V2 Yoake. This will help you get familiar with the node usage process after the mainnet launches more quickly. We will also incentivize all captain node owners who participate in pre-mining on Tabi Testnet V2 Yoake.\


**Please note that the startup times for Captain Nodes at different tiers vary.** If your Captain Node has not yet reached its startup time, you will see it in a \<Waiting> status after assignment and can check the detailed startup time. **After you complete the assigned node, you only need to keep the node client running. When your node tier reaches the start time, your node will automatically enter the \<running> state.** **Before you start Captain Node Pre-mining, we recommend that you read the following article to learn all information about Captain Node.**
