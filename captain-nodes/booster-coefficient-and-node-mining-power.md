# Booster Coefficient and Node Mining Power

The **booster coefficient** significantly influences the rewards your Captain Node can earn. It is based on the **Personal Stake Rate** and exponentially boosts the overall **Node Mining Power**, resulting in increased $veTABI production.

**Booster Coefficient Formula:**

$$
\text{Booster Coefficient} = e^{6.66 \times \text{Personal Stake Rate}}
$$

This exponential increase means that as you stake more $tabi, your **Booster Coefficient** increases, driving your **Node Mining Power** up substantially. The **Personal Stake Rate** is capped at 100%, meaning staking beyond that point will not further increase the coefficient.

**Impact of Booster Coefficient:**

* Delaying $veTABI claims and continuously increasing your stake will maximize your **Booster Coefficient**, which exponentially increases your node's mining output.
* Claiming early or reducing your stake will lower your **Booster Coefficient**, resulting in less $veTABI production over time.

To be a **smart miner**, it's crucial to **delay claims** and increase your stake in $tabi to maintain a high **Booster Coefficient** and achieve the best possible mining rewards.
