## What is Tabichain?
Tabichain is a scalable Proof-of-Stake blockchain that is fully compatible and interoperable with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is built using the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/) which runs on top of the [CometBFT](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft) (a fork of [Tendermint Core](https://docs.tendermint.com/)) consensus engine, to accomplish fast finality, high transaction throughput and short block times (\~5 seconds).
