# Overview

### What is Tabichain?

Tabichain is a scalable Proof-of-Stake blockchain that is fully compatible and interoperable with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is built using the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/) which runs on top of the [CometBFT](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft) (a fork of [Tendermint Core](https://docs.tendermint.com/)) consensus engine, to accomplish fast finality, high transaction throughput and short block times (\~5 seconds).

### Infrastructure on Tabichain

* **Captain Nodes**: Tabi Captain Nodes are the governors of the Tabi Incentive Mechanism, crucial to determining the flow of rewards, revenue distribution, and ecosystem development within TabiChain.
* **Tabi Dashboard:** The Tabi Dashboard is an integral part of the TabiChain infrastructure, offering comprehensive management tools. It allows users to manage node and device bindings, allocate node power, claim $veTABI (test token) rewards, and monitor mining boosters that enhance $veTABI (test token) production. This ensures users have complete control over their nodes and mining operations.
* **Tabi Station**: Tabi Station enhances user interaction within the TabiChain ecosystem. It includes a staking module for staking or unstaking $TABI (test token) with preferred validators, a convert module for seamless $TABI (test token) and $veTABI (test token) conversions, and a governance module for participating in chain governance, viewing proposals, and voting.
* **Tabi Explorer**: The Tabichain Explorer is a powerful online tool that allows users to view all transactions and smart contract activities on the Tabichain.
