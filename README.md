# Overview

## What is Tabichain?

  Tabi’s vision is to become the leading Web3 consumer chain, built on underlying architecture that lowers the barriers of entry for developers and users alike, supporting consumer crypto apps in all becoming the killer app of Web3, and bringing about true mass adoption of crypto.
To do so, Tabi will be hyper-focused on onboarding Web2 users into the space and on solving the distribution problem that Web3 consumer apps face. Tabi will become both a thriving ecosystem for apps and users alike, and also the Web3 coordinating mechanism in our attention economy, by directing users’ attention productively to uniquely crypto consumer apps.

### Poly-Apps
  Tabi proposes the concept of Poly-Apps, which are dApps built on Tabi’s Polymorphic VM (PVM) tech that can sit on top of existing Web2 social platforms, be developed using familiar Web2 languages and frameworks, while being seamlessly compatible and interoperable with multiple blockchains.
  This is reminiscent of Super-Apps in Web2 such as WeChat and Grab that offer a range of other products together, including payments and financial services, but without the limitations of centralization and siloed ecosystems. Developers can build dApps in open ecosystems with multi-chain interoperability and composability between different dApps, with user identity and reputation aggregated on-chain too.

  By leveraging Web2 social platforms as a gateway, consumer apps can also solve for the distribution problem that Web3 dApps often face, being able to now distribute directly to Web2 mainstream audiences as well.

### Proof-of-Attention Token Economy
  Tabi introduces a Proof-of-Attention token economy model, whereby $TABI serves as the main governance and utility token within the Tabi ecosystem and can also effectively become the universal token for attention.

  $TABI will be used as a coordinating mechanism to direct users’ attention to various consumer apps, activating communities to collectively focus their attention on productive goals that can actually drive value to the consumer apps they use and like, thus creating symbiotic relationships as opposed to purely mercenary user liquidity.

### User Distribution Engine
  A user distribution engine is also built in with the objective of helping developers and consumer apps be able to search for their target profile of users based on their offchain and onchain data.

  For dApps, this effectively serves as another way of acquiring users across platforms and blockchains in a more cost-effective and targeted yet flexible way too. Developers can build dApps that are richer and more personalized in nature, whereas users can also be recommended dApps that they would most be interested in or be most suitable for, based on their identity profile and activities, thus achieving a smoother consumer experience too.

### Polymorphic Virtual Machine (PVM)
  The PVM provides a universal blockchain FACADE, which can help developers to ignore the difference between blockchains. The only thing that needs to be done by developers is studying PVM-SDKs and PVM Omni Protocol.
