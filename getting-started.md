### Why develop dApps on Tabichain?

The Tabichain Core Development Team is on a mission to provide the foundational tools necessary for building the cross-chain applications of the future, freeing developers from the confines of todayâ€™s siloed blockchains.

Tabichain focuses on cross-chain **innovation** so that developers can build entirely new dApp experiences for their users. Deploying smart contracts on Tabichain is **easy**, as the Tabichain blockchain is fully compatible with Ethereum and its rich ecosystem of robust tooling, wallets, explorers, a surplus of assets, and intelligent end-users.
