# Tier System and Activation Timing

The **tier system** determines when a Captain Node is activated for mining. Each **tier** has a specific **mining activation time**, making it essential for node owners to monitor their activation schedule to maximize early rewards.

**Tier-Based Mining Activation:**

* Each **Node Level** has multiple **tiers**, and the mining activation time depends on the specific tier.
* **Lower tiers** start mining earlier than higher tiers within the same level.
* The **Technological Progress Factor** improves efficiency for nodes that activate later, but their rewards may be delayed due to the later start.

**Strategic Takeaways:**

* Keep an eye on **official announcements** from the Forecaster Layer to know when your tier is activated.
* Early mining activation provides a competitive advantage, so ensure you are ready to start mining as soon as your tier goes live.

By understanding **booster factor** and **tier activation timing**, you can significantly enhance your long-term returns from mining $veTABI.
