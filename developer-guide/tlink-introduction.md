# TLink Introduction

**TLink** is a groundbreaking layer designed to revolutionize Web3 onboarding by integrating social platform accounts like TikTok, Snapchat, and Telegram into the crypto ecosystem. With just one click, users can transform their social profiles into crypto wallets, enjoy gas fee sponsorships for transactions, and maintain full control over their identity and data. For developers, **TLink** provides an interoperable SDK, leveraging **PolyVM** to lower the barriers for Web2 developers familiar with JavaScript, Java, and other mainstream languages. This enables them to seamlessly build and deploy applications on **TVM** (Ton Virtual Machine), attracting both users and developers from other platforms to the **PolyVM** ecosystem. By ensuring privacy, security, and seamless asset integration, **TLink** paves the way for true mass adoption of Web3.
