# Testnet V2

We're gonna to launch the Testnet V2 in August after the Tabi Captain Node Pre-sale
On Testnet V2, we will gradually open dapps. Meanwhile, if you own a node, you can also participate in Test-mining to get test token, which allows you to experience all functions on Tabi Testnet V2

## Test-mining   
In order to test the chain's performance and ensure the normal operation of the mining mechanism before the Tabi mainnet launch, Tabi will launch Test-mining on Testnet V2.

Participating in Test-mining will be a great opportunity for you to understand the Tabi Captain Node mining mechanism. You will be able to personally operate and use the client to run your captain node.When the mainnet goes live, you can join the official node mining at the fastest speed.

When users have nodes, they can run clients on the Testnet V2 to mine test token. Test token is not equivalent to $Tabi when the mainnet goes live, but we will incentivize users who participate in Test-mining. After the mainnet launch, users can exchange test tokens for $Tabi at a certain ratio.
