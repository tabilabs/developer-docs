# $seedTABI



#### What Is seedTABI?

* **seedTABI** is a **non-transferable** token on Ethereum that represents your future entitlement to **TABI** on TabiChain’s mainnet.
* It cannot be traded or transferred but acts as a placeholder for eventual **TABI**.

#### How Does It Become TABI?

1. **Claim & Burn**: After a specified time, you burn your seedTABI to instantly receive a percentage of **TABI**.
2. **Tiered Conversion Schedule**:
   1. **0–89 Days**: Get 20% TABI, 80% burned
   2. **90–179 Days**: Get 30% TABI, 70% burned
   3. **180–269 Days**: Get 50% TABI, 50% burned
   4. **270–330 Days**: Get 70% TABI, 30% burned
   5. **Beyond 330 Days**: 100% TABI (no burn penalty)

#### Why Non-Transferable?

seedTABI is meant only to track your eventual TABI allocation. Restricting transfers prevents speculation before mainnet issuance.

#### KYC & Harvest

* Users may need **KYC** clearance to claim seedTABI and convert it to TABI.
* If KYC fails, you may lose eligibility to convert.

#### Example

* You have 10,000 seedTABI.
* If you convert at day 100, you get 30% = 3,000 TABI, and the remaining 7,000 seedTABI is burned.
